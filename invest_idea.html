    <h1>Worldwide investing App using Crypto and Mirrored Assets</h1>
    <p>
      This is an applied Cryptocurrency idea I've had for a while and it stems
      from the fact that not everyone in the world has equal access to stocks
      and other commodities, in the name of anti money laundering at the cost of
      user censhorship. If there was a way to allow every person that has access
      to the internet to have a fast and easy way to invest in the stock market
      I believe everyone in the world could grow substantially richer. Crypto
      gives us just that. It's a type of money that doesn't care about who you
      are or what you do, it only cares about whether or not you have the money
      and access to the internet. With that in mind, I stambled upon
      mirror.finance, which is a blockchain project that mirrors the price of
      certain assets like stocks and commodities. The problem I currently find
      in the mirror protocol is that the underlying asset is never actually
      bought. So I want to create a protocol that actually purchases the
      underlying asset and tracks the price of the asset and I'd like to put it
      all together in an user friendly interface, no KYC required.

      No KYC is the key, but how can I make that happen without getting fined
      for not complying with regulation? That I'm not sure of as of yet. I was
      thinking that maybe KYC has to be required if the user wants to actually
      own the underlying asset, otherwise the asset will be owned by a nonprofit
      organization that runs the project. Furthermore, if an user wants to go
      through a KYC process, than they might as well just buy the actual stock
      right? I suppose that would be an option, but the beauty of owning a
      mirrored asset that tracks the price of the underlying stock is that, when
      the market is open, the user could buy and sell as many times as they see
      fit in an attempt to generate even more wealth. Basically, it's a way
      around PDT limitations of 3 day trades every 4 working days. Also, API
      access to all of this would allow tech savvy users to create automation
      bots to trade without needing $25k to get unlimited day trades. But again,
      that's only if the user wants to own the actual underlying asset,
      otherwise KYC would not be necessary since the assets would just be held
      by the company that runs the show.

      Offering debit cards could be prettt interesting though easy to implement.
      Now in regards to credit lines, that's when things get interesting.
      Imaging having a credit card backed by all the assets you own with a
      theoretical maximum that you couls borrow at all times at the lowest rates
      available provided from liquidity pools such as the aave protocol. An
      algorith could be designed to, depending on the size of the purchase and
      the time that you expect to repay the loan by, minimize the cost of
      borrowing that money. Let's talk about an example to explain my thoughts
      here. Let's say that you own $5000 between your crypto assets and
      securities held at your wallet. Well, if you could borrow against those
      assets at 60% LTV you would have a hypothetical maximum credit available
      of $3000. Now let's say that you go to diner and spend $250 and you wanna
      use your cool cryyo credit card to pay for it, let's say that you get paid
      next week and you can repay those $250 in about 7 days. If that's the
      case, you could take some risks with variable rates on AAVE which at the
      moment are 3.29% APR variable or 10.65% APR fixed. Either way you're only
      borrowing the money for 7 days so in both cases you'll be paying far less
      in interest than if you had used an actual credit card that on average has
      a sixteen percent APR. And of course, you could also deploy your own
      trading bot that uses leverage and trades 24/7 to offset the cost of
      borrowing that money anyway which means that in that scenario not only
      would you be saving with lower rates, but also making money assuming a
      conservative 2% daily yield of your trading bot.
