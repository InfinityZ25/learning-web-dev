                    Atlantis is a Decentralized Autonomous Application (hereby to be called D.A.A., DAA, or $D2A)
                    that will allow cosmopolitans equal access to public equity & crypto markets with the goal to
                    achieve freedom & economic prosperity in our token bearers' motherlands.
                    The goal of this product is to develop a single protocol through which all financial instituions &
                    private individuals will transact real-world & digital (a.k.a ground-truth, or $GT.v) value.

                    At Hynix, we believe that privacy is key for any free market to thrive. In search for such
                    asipiration, we've determined that the appropiate manner to handle the complex problem of KYC & AML,
                    is by not handling it.
                    We believe that our token holders shouldn't be required to give up their anonimity in order to
                    utilize our protocol, be it in a commercial or non-commercial way. As such, we'll operate under the
                    principles of 'privacy first' & will never collect any data, or metadata, that could in any way
                    compromise the identiy of our token bearers.
                    Anonimity will be completely kept with one exception: token bearers who decide to stake their tokens
                    in any of our private
                    yield-farming investment strategies must disclose to The Oracle of Truth their identity in order to
                    protect the network from external byzantine attacks.
                </p>
                <!-- Atlantis Values & Principles. -->
                <p class='values'>
                    We'll achieve this goal by creating an oracle of truth powered by the network's native currency:
                    Hopium-- henceforth to be known as Hopium, $HOPE.m, or Hope. --.
                    At Hynix, we understand that hopium can't be the only thing to run an economy off of, so we have
                    decided to follow my favorite company value: Zen-- henceforth to be known as $HOPE.z, $ZEN, $PEAC.e,
                    or $CHILL. --.
                </p>
                <!-- Chapter II: Justice & Injustice. -->
                <p class='justice'>
                    Investment strategies will be regulated in accordance to the token bearer's 'Law Of The Land.' If
                    there isn't a standarized set of regulation in the token bearer's nation-- hereby to be called
                    $HOM.e --, they will be exonerated from the unjust process of compromising their anonimity.

                    If the law of the land has regulation in pertenence to the topic of any outlaw of digital assets, an
                    Oracle of Truth of
                    the Justice Division will automatically
                    declare the KYC &/ AML Process-- as
                    well as any other process in the nation -- as unjust, and will autonomously liquidate all assets in
                    order to pay back all liabilities with the goal to minimize risk and maximize the reduction of
                    profit loss. If any token bearer who is in the negative is clasiffied a "looter" their assets will
                    be liquidated first in order to preserve the production of the farmers.

                    Nations in violation of the principles of anonimity, freedom, and objective truth will autonomously
                    trigger an audit by the oracle of truh. This process will initialize a Decentralized Autonomous
                    Hearing-- henceforth refered to as $DAH, $OBVIUM, DaH, or Obvium. --.

                    A quorum will be held on the following optimal meeting day -- henceforth to be known as OMD, $OMD,
                    $ALEX.o, or $ALEX.io -- in accordance to all token bearer's public schedule ($SC.p).
