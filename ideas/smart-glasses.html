    <h2>Smart Glasses idea powered by Transparent OLED panels.</h2>
    <p>
      Use <a href="https://oled.com/oleds/transparent-oleds-toleds/">this transparent TOLEDs display</a> to create smart glasses which can show you display whatever 
      image or data you want via an <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/Xserver.1.xhtml">X11 Display Server</a> powered by a tiny linux machine 
      running in the frame of the glasses. Battery is also a problem, using solid state batteries could make it easier but QS won't be in production until 2025. Regardless,
      power consumption by the panel is pretty low, 18-hour battery life is possible using something like CATL's LFP battery, which are pretty cheap but that possibility is contingent
      upon an extremely low power consumption by the cpu used, it must be ARM based since x86 consumes insane amounts of energy. In terms of sillicion, Taiwan Semiconductors ($TSMC) have great
      5nm tech right now, so the difficult part would be licensing arm and getting the knowhow on how to design a chip from scratch. Arm seems to have a bunch of resource for custom SOCs
